# Inconsistent Promise and Callback Handling in Node.js Express App

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often subtle, error in Node.js applications: inconsistent handling of promises and callbacks. Mixing these approaches without careful consideration can lead to unexpected behavior, unhandled exceptions, and difficult-to-debug issues.

## The Problem

The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js application with two endpoints that fetch data asynchronously. One uses promises with `.then()` and `.catch()`, while the other uses a traditional callback function.  This inconsistency can lead to problems.  For example, if the asynchronous operation fails in the callback-based endpoint, error handling might be incomplete.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code.  It consistently uses promises and error handling to ensure that all asynchronous operations are handled gracefully, regardless of success or failure.  This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and reliability.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the necessary packages: `npm install express`
4. Run `node bug.js` to see the inconsistent example.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved version.

This example highlights the importance of maintaining a consistent approach to asynchronous operations in Node.js to avoid unexpected errors and improve code quality.
